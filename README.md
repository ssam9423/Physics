# Physics

 Various physics based simulations and numerical solutions all written in Python:
   - Projectile: Numerically calculates the path of a projectile.
   - Laplace Equation: Numerically solves a Laplace Equation and a Poisson Equation (Electromagnetics)
   - Electrical Field: Numerically plots the Electrical field four point charges
   - E-Field Motion: Numerically integrates the motion of a point charge moving through a ring charge
   - Electronic Potential: Numerically plot the electric potential as a function of radius of a sphere
   - Windmill Power Graphs: Plotted the actual and theoretical power and the efficiency of a windmill as a function of wind speed
   - Gas Equilibrium Sim: Shows an animation of an non-ideal gas as it reaches equilibrium then plots the kinetic energy and velocities of the gas particles in comparison to their statistical mechanic theories
